Thinking models such as R1 and o1 improve their reasoning accuracy at test time as the length of the reasoning context increases. However, compared with training-time scaling, test-time scaling is fundamentally limited by the limited context length of base models, which remains orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of tokens consumed during training. We revisit test-time enhancement techniques through the lens of scaling effect and introduce a unified framework of multi-dimensional test-time scaling to extend the capacity of test-time reasoning. Beyond conventional context-length scaling, we consider two additional dimensions: batch scaling, where accuracy improves with parallel sampling, and turn scaling, where iterative self-refinement enhances reasoning quality. Building on this perspective, we propose 3D test-time scaling, which integrates context, batch, and turn scaling. We show that: (1) each dimension demonstrates a test-time scaling effect, but with a bounded capacity; (2) combining all three dimensions substantially improves the reasoning performance of challenging testbeds, including IOI, IMO, and CPHO, and further benefits from human preference feedback; and (3) the human-in-the-loop framework naturally extends to a more open-ended domain, i.e., embodied learning, which enables the design of humanoid control behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u6279\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8f6e\u6b21\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6d88\u8017\u7684token\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u7ef4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u3001\u6279\u5904\u7406\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u8f6e\u6b21\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7cbe\u70bc\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u5e94\u4f46\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347IOI\u3001IMO\u548cCPHO\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5177\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e09\u7ef4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u5355\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Our workflow integrates a large selection of data sources comprising Solar Dynamic Observatory data, solar irradiance indices (F10.7), solar wind parameters (velocity and interplanetary magnetic field), geomagnetic activity indices (Kp, AE, SYM-H), and NASA JPL's Global Ionospheric Maps of Total Electron Content (GIM-TEC). We also implement geospatially sparse data such as the TEC derived from the World-Wide GNSS Receiver Network and crowdsourced Android smartphone measurements. This novel heterogeneous dataset is temporally and spatially aligned into a single, modular data structure that supports both physical and data-driven modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we train and benchmark several spatiotemporal machine learning architectures for forecasting vertical TEC under both quiet and geomagnetically active conditions.

Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In practical workflows, designers typically generate and edit each RGBA layer independently before compositing them into a final raster image. However, this process is irreversible: once composited, layer-level editing is no longer possible. Existing methods commonly rely on image matting and inpainting, but remain limited in controllability and segmentation precision. To address these challenges, we propose two key modules: LayerDecompose-DiT (LD-DiT), which decouples image elements into distinct layers and enables fine-grained control; and Multi-Layer Conditional Adapter (MLCA), which injects target image information into multi-layer tokens to achieve precise conditional generation. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, we build a new benchmark and introduce tailored evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that CLD consistently outperforms existing methods in both decomposition quality and controllability. Furthermore, the separated layers produced by CLD can be directly manipulated in commonly used design tools such as PowerPoint, highlighting its practical value and applicability in real-world creative workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faControllable Layer Decomposition (CLD)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6805\u683c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53ef\u63a7\u591a\u5c42\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u901a\u5e38\u72ec\u7acb\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91RGBA\u5c42\u540e\u518d\u5408\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u540e\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u5c42\u7ea7\u7f16\u8f91\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\u50cf\u62a0\u56fe\u548c\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\uff1aLayerDecompose-DiT (LD-DiT)\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5143\u7d20\u89e3\u8026\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u5c42\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff1bMulti-Layer Conditional Adapter (MLCA)\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u4fe1\u606f\u6ce8\u5165\u591a\u5c42token\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCLD\u5728\u5206\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u56fe\u5c42\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5728PowerPoint\u7b49\u5e38\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "CLD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u56fe\u5c42\u5206\u79bb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6ee1\u8db3\u771f\u5b9e\u521b\u610f\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols.

Our visualization shows improved alignment between splats and dynamic objects, and the error correction method's capability to identify errors and properly initialize new splats.

We present a lightweight, transparent multimodal ensemble that fuses physiological time-series measurements with unstructured clinical notes from the first 48 hours of an ICU stay. A logistic regression model combines predictions from two modality-specific models: a bidirectional LSTM for vitals and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for notes. This traceable architecture allows for multilevel interpretability: feature attributions within each modality and direct per-case modality attributions quantifying how vitals and notes influence each decision. On the MIMIC-III benchmark, our late-fusion ensemble improves discrimination over the best single model (AUPRC 0.565 vs. 0.526; AUROC 0.891 vs. 0.876) while maintaining well-calibrated predictions.

The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \\emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation.

There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.\n  To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Box6D\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u4ed3\u5e93\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u50a8\u7bb1\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u7ea76D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21RGB-D\u89c2\u6d4b\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u65ad\u7bb1\u5b50\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea676%\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ed3\u5e93\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u62e3\u8d27\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u67096D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786eCAD\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\uff1b\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6613\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u7c7b\u522b\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u73af\u5883\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u6b21RGB-D\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f\u4e8c\u5206\u641c\u7d22\u63a8\u65ad\u7bb1\u5b50\u5c3a\u5bf8\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522bCAD\u6a21\u677f\u800c\u975e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5408\u7406\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u548c\u65e9\u505c\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u62d2\u7edd\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4ed3\u50a8\u573a\u666f\u548c\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cBox6D\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u76846D\u59ff\u6001\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea676%\u3002", "conclusion": "Box6D\u4e3a\u4ed3\u5e93\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u7bb16D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This stems from a critical \\textit{rationale gap}, where sparse domain data is insufficient to bridge the semantic distance between complex spatio-temporal content and abstract classification labels. We propose a two-stage self-improvement paradigm to bridge this gap without new annotations. First, we prompt the VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for each video, compelling them to articulate the domain-specific logic. The VLM is then fine-tuned on these self-generated rationales, utilizing this intermediate supervision to align its representations with the nuances of the target domain. Second, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on the task labels, achieving markedly higher effectiveness as a result of the model's pre-acquired domain reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms direct SFT, validating self-generated rationale as an effective, annotation-efficient paradigm for adapting VLMs to domain-specific video analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u5f25\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u65b0\u6807\u6ce8\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f25\u5408\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u7a7a\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u62bd\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u793aVLMs\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec6\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u9610\u8ff0\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u903b\u8f91\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03VLM\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u95f4\u76d1\u7763\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u9886\u57df\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9002\u5e94VLMs\u5230\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6709\u6548\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u5230\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002"}}

To improve acceptance and decoding efficiency, recent work has explored the multi-draft extension, where at each step $n$ draft tokens are generated, and the verification criterion is a distribution conditioned on these. When this criterion maximizes the probability of accepting some draft token, it is called the optimal transport (OT). However, finding the OT is difficult, as it is the solution of a linear program (OTLP) in over $V^n$ variables, with $V$ being the vocabulary size. Two recent theoretical works have reframed the OTLP in terms of importance sampling or subset selection. In this work, we prove that these formulations are equivalent to an exponentially large relaxed OTLP, so it remains infeasible to solve. Then, we reverse engineer subset selection to formulate the OTLP as a max-flow problem. With a novel application of polymatroid theory, we reduce the exponentially large OTLP to a convex optimization problem in at most $V$ variables. This allows us to devise an algorithm for optimal $n$-draft speculative sampling when the $n$ tokens are chosen i.i.d. from a single draft model, which can be tuned to arbitrary accuracy. Finally, we measure acceptance rates and algorithm runtimes for various $n$ and top-$k$ draft sampling settings.

Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

To address this challenge, we introduce FuncBind, a framework based on computer vision to generate target-conditioned, all-atom molecules across atomic systems. FuncBind uses neural fields to represent molecules as continuous atomic densities and employs score-based generative models with modern architectures adapted from the computer vision literature. This modality-agnostic representation allows a single unified model to be trained on diverse atomic systems, from small to large molecules, and handle variable atom/residue counts, including non-canonical amino acids. FuncBind achieves competitive in silico performance in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody complementarity-determining region loops, conditioned on target structures. FuncBind also generated in vitro novel antibody binders via de novo redesign of the complementarity-determining region H3 loop of two chosen co-crystal structures. As a final contribution, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for structure-conditioned macrocyclic peptide generation.

We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals).

In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning.

However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision.

This work explores fairness in multi-modal medical image reasoning using in-context learning", "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08FADS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u91c7\u6837\u6784\u5efa\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5e73\u8861\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8de8\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8bf4\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\uff08FADS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u91c7\u6837\u6784\u5efa\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u5e73\u8861\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u56e0\u9009\u62e9\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFADS\u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e0e\u6027\u522b\u3001\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u65cf\u88d4\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Stochastic Gradient Descent Unlearning", "comment": null, "summary": "Machine unlearning algorithms aim to remove the impact of selected training data from a model without the computational expenses of retraining from scratch. Two such algorithms are ``Descent-to-Delete\" (D2D) and ``Rewind-to-Delete\" (R2D), full-batch gradient descent algorithms that are easy to implement and satisfy provable unlearning guarantees. In particular, the stochastic version of D2D is widely implemented as the ``finetuning\" unlearning baseline, despite lacking theoretical backing on nonconvex functions. In this work, we prove $(\u03b5, \u03b4)$ certified unlearning guarantees for stochastic R2D and D2D for strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex loss functions, by analyzing unlearning through the lens of disturbed or biased gradient systems, which may be contracting, semi-contracting, or expansive respectively. Our argument relies on optimally coupling the random behavior of the unlearning and retraining trajectories, resulting in a probabilistic sensitivity bound that can be combined with a novel relaxed Gaussian mechanism to achieve $(\u03b5, \u03b4)$ unlearning. We determine that D2D can yield tighter guarantees for strongly convex functions compared to R2D by relying on contraction to a unique global minimum. However, unlike D2D, R2D can achieve unlearning in the convex and nonconvex setting because it draws the unlearned model closer to the retrained model by reversing the accumulated disturbances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u968f\u673aRewind-to-Delete\uff08R2D\uff09\u548cDescent-to-Delete\uff08D2D\uff09\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u3001\u51f8\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u7684(\u03b5, \u03b4)\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9057\u5fd8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u53d7\u6270\u6216\u6709\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u578b\u677e\u5f1b\u9ad8\u65af\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u9057\u5fd8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\u9009\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4ece\u5934\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002D2D\u548cR2D\u662f\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u9057\u5fd8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5168\u6279\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u673a\u7248\u672c\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u53d7\u6270\u6216\u6709\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u6536\u7f29\u3001\u534a\u6536\u7f29\u6216\u6269\u5f20\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u89c6\u4e3a\u6270\u52a8\u68af\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u8026\u5408\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u968f\u673a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6982\u7387\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u578b\u677e\u5f1b\u9ad8\u65af\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0(\u03b5, \u03b4)\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u968f\u673aR2D\u548cD2D\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u3001\u51f8\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u7684(\u03b5, \u03b4)\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9057\u5fd8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002D2D\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4R2D\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u800cR2D\u5728\u51f8\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u8f6c\u7d2f\u79ef\u6270\u52a8\u4f7f\u9057\u5fd8\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86R2D\u548cD2D\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u4e0b\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that synergistically integrates two complementary approaches: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). Instead of the coarse practice of aligning marginal distributions of the treatments in latent space, SGA uses iterative treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups. Aligning these fine-grained groups achieves improved distributional matching, thus leading to more effective deconfounding. We theoretically demonstrate that SGA optimizes a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically verify its deconfounding efficacy. RTM promotes temporal generalization by randomly replacing input covariates with Gaussian noises during training. This encourages the model to rely less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated covariates at the current step and more on stable historical patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize across time and better preserve underlying causal relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that while applying SGA and RTM individually improves counterfactual outcome estimation, their synergistic combination consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. This success comes from their distinct yet complementary roles: RTM enhances temporal generalization and robustness across time steps, while SGA improves deconfounding at each specific time point.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u5b50\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\u5bf9\u9f50(SGA)\u548c\u968f\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u63a9\u7801(RTM)\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u6df7\u6742\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u51b3\u7b56\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ece\u672a\u88ab\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df7\u6742\u53d8\u91cf\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\u5e76\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u626d\u66f2\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSGA\u548cRTM\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aSGA\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6cbb\u7597\u65e0\u5173\u805a\u7c7b\u8bc6\u522b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b50\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\uff1bRTM\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u968f\u673a\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u66ff\u6362\u8f93\u5165\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u72ec\u5e94\u7528SGA\u548cRTM\u90fd\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u534f\u540c\u7ec4\u5408\u59cb\u7ec8\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SGA\u548cRTM\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u4f46\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff1aRTM\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800cSGA\u6539\u8fdb\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u53bb\u6df7\u6742\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation.

In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation.

However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities. Results show that the generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on multiple downstream tasks, including yield and nitrogen prediction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal correspondence learning to bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agricultural monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f5c\u7269\u51a0\u5c42\u6027\u72b6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u536b\u661f\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u4f3c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u4ea7\u91cf\u548c\u6c2e\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u4f5c\u7269\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u4f46\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u536b\u661f\u4efb\u52a1\u867d\u7136\u8986\u76d6\u5e7f\u4f46\u53d7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u73b0\u4ee3\u5fae\u5730\u5757\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u7389\u7c73\u5e26\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u70b9\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u7ea684\u4e2a\u6742\u4ea4\u7389\u7c73\u54c1\u79cd\u7684\u5171\u914d\u51c6\u536b\u661f-\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\u4f20\u611f\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5149\u8c31\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8868\u5f81\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4ea7\u91cf\u548c\u6c2e\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u5f25\u5408\u519c\u4e1a\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u536b\u661f\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f20\u611f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f5c\u7269\u6027\u72b6\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Change-of-basis (CoB) pruning addresses this challenge by applying orthogonal linear transformations that concentrate importance within certain dimensions. However, many standard deep learning architectures are not inherently invariant to such transformations. To enable compatibility, we introduce two-subspace radial activations (TSRAs): an activation family that is invariant to orthogonal linear transformations applied independently within its two activation subspaces. This invariance allows CoB transformations to be merged into surrounding weights without incurring extra parameters. We position this work as a proof-of-concept that a rotationally invariant design may offer a principled approach towards change-of-basis pruning. We do not provide an analysis of multiple TSRA candidates nor do we explore weight initialization for any TSRAs. These limitations, combined with other necessary modifications we make to permit rotational invariance, result in a slight accuracy drop of $4.52\\%$ compared to a ReLU-based control. However, using activation-magnitude importance, VGG-16 implementing our CoB+TSRA framework shows encouraging results on CIFAR-10. Under fixed-ratio structured pruning, CoB improves accuracy over a TSRA baseline at all pruning ratios and extends reliable pruning frontier from roughly $30\\%$ to $70\\%$ of parameters without post-prune fine tuning. Under threshold-based pruning strategies, CoB prunes $90-96\\%$ of parameters while maintaining $1-6\\%$ accuracy drop after fine-tuning. Together, these results indicate that rotationally invariant architectures may offer a promising path towards CoB pruning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570TSRA\uff0c\u4f7fchange-of-basis\u526a\u679d\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u96c6\u4e2d\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u800cchange-of-basis\u526a\u679d\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u53d8\u6362\u53ef\u4ee5\u96c6\u4e2d\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u51c6\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u53d8\u6362\u4e0d\u5177\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f84\u5411\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570(TSRA)\uff0c\u8be5\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8CoB\u53d8\u6362\u5408\u5e76\u5230\u5468\u56f4\u6743\u91cd\u4e2d\u800c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728VGG-16\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0CoB+TSRA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6bd4\u4f8b\u526a\u679d\u4e0bCoB\u5728\u6240\u6709\u526a\u679d\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8eTSRA\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u526a\u679d\u524d\u6cbf\u4ece30%\u6269\u5c55\u523070%\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u9608\u503c\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u53ef\u526a\u966490-96%\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d1-6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3achange-of-basis\u526a\u679d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u57284.52%\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u526a\u679d\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002"}}

While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality.

This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations.

This article describes a new two-step process to design a more refined resume evaluation model based on a small language model (<600M parameters) that is finetuned using GRPO on a custom reward function. To begin with, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) was used to build a solid baseline model. Second, this SFT model was also optimized with the help of Reinforcement Learning (RL) through GRPO under the guidance of a new, multi-component reward function that can holistically assess candidates beyond simple keyword matching. We indicate that the RL application presents a critical problem of reward hacking due to the initial experiments of aggressive penalties, which produces faulty, excessively negative model behaviors. We have overcome this challenge by refining the reward function repeatedly and training hyperparameters into a stable \"gentle polishing process\" of the reward function. Our resulting GRPO-polished model demonstrates significant real-world efficacy, achieving a final accuracy of 91% on unseen test data. The model shows a strong ability to correctly identify qualified candidates (recall of 0.85 for the 'SELECTED' class) while also showing exceptional precision (1.0), confirming its reliability.

This work investigates the \"Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter\" (AOPF) class as a solution. We introduce two models operating in the [-1, 1] domain: 1) `L-JacobiNet`, the adaptive generalization of `ChebyNet` with learnable alpha, beta shape parameters, and 2) `S-JacobiNet`, a novel baseline representing a LayerNorm-stabilized static `ChebyNet`. Our analysis, comparing these models against AOPFs in the [0, infty) domain (e.g., `LaguerreNet`), reveals critical, previously unknown trade-offs. We find that the [0, infty) domain is superior for modeling heterophily, while the [-1, 1] domain (Jacobi) provides superior numerical stability at high K (K>20). Most significantly, we discover that `ChebyNet`'s main flaw is stabilization, not its static nature. Our static `S-JacobiNet` (ChebyNet+LayerNorm) outperforms the adaptive `L-JacobiNet` on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets, identifying `S-JacobiNet` as a powerful, overlooked baseline and suggesting that adaptation in the [-1, 1] domain can lead to overfitting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668(AOPF)\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8c31GNN\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86L-JacobiNet\u548cS-JacobiNet\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0[0,\u221e)\u57df\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u800c[-1,1]\u57df\u5728\u9ad8\u9636\u65f6\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4e14ChebyNet\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u800c\u975e\u9759\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8c31GNN\u5982ChebyNet\u7531\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5728[-1,1]\u57df\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1\uff09L-JacobiNet\uff08ChebyNet\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684alpha\u3001beta\u5f62\u72b6\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c2\uff09S-JacobiNet\uff08LayerNorm\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9759\u6001ChebyNet\u57fa\u7ebf\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e[0,\u221e)\u57df\u7684AOPF\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "[0,\u221e)\u57df\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800c[-1,1]\u57df\u5728\u9ad8K\u503c(K>20)\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u9759\u6001S-JacobiNet\u57285\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u76844\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94L-JacobiNet\u3002", "conclusion": "ChebyNet\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7f3a\u9677\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u975e\u9759\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0cS-JacobiNet\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c[-1,1]\u57df\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002"}}

This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone.

Due to limitations in dataset sizes, many models are trained by aggregating bioactivity data from diverse sources, including public databases such as ChEMBL. However, this approach often introduces significant noise due to variability in experimental protocols. We introduce AssayMatch, a framework for data selection that builds smaller, more homogenous training sets attuned to the test set of interest. AssayMatch leverages data attribution methods to quantify the contribution of each training assay to model performance. These attribution scores are used to finetune language embeddings of text-based assay descriptions to capture not just semantic similarity, but also the compatibility between assays. Unlike existing data attribution methods, our approach enables data selection for a test set with unknown labels, mirroring real-world drug discovery campaigns where the activities of candidate molecules are not known in advance. At test time, embeddings finetuned with AssayMatch are used to rank all available training data. We demonstrate that models trained on data selected by AssayMatch are able to surpass the performance of the model trained on the complete dataset, highlighting its ability to effectively filter out harmful or noisy experiments. We perform experiments on two common machine learning architectures and see increased prediction capability over a strong language-only baseline for 9/12 model-target pairs. AssayMatch provides a data-driven mechanism to curate higher-quality datasets, reducing noise from incompatible experiments and improving the predictive power and data efficiency of models for drug discovery.

Rad-GS combines the advantages of raw radar point cloud with Doppler information and geometrically enhanced point cloud to guide dynamic object masking in synchronized images, thereby alleviating rendering artifacts and improving localization accuracy. Additionally, unsynchronized image frames are leveraged to globally refine the 3D Gaussian representation, enhancing texture consistency and novel view synthesis fidelity. Furthermore, the global octree structure coupled with a targeted Gaussian primitive management strategy further suppresses noise and significantly reduces memory consumption in large-scale environments. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that Rad-GS achieves performance comparable to traditional 3D Gaussian methods based on camera or LiDAR inputs, highlighting the feasibility of robust outdoor mapping using 4D mmWave radar.

Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL.

Although many studies have used deep learning or generative AI methods to model trajectories and have achieved promising results, the robustness and interpretability of such models are largely unexplored. This limits the application of trajectory generation algorithms on noisy real-world data and their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we exploit the regular structure in urban trajectories and propose a deep generative model based on the pathlet representation, which encode trajectories with binary vectors associated with a learned dictionary of trajectory segments. Specifically, we introduce a probabilistic graphical model to describe the trajectory generation process, which includes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) component and a linear decoder component. During training, the model can simultaneously learn the latent embedding of pathlet representations and the pathlet dictionary that captures mobility patterns in the trajectory dataset. The conditional version of our model can also be used to generate customized trajectories based on temporal and spatial constraints.\n  Our model can effectively learn data distribution even using noisy data, achieving relative improvements of $35.4\\%$ and $26.3\\%$ over strong baselines on two real-world trajectory datasets. Moreover, the generated trajectories can be conveniently utilized for multiple downstream tasks, including trajectory prediction and data denoising.

Motivated by this observation, we propose DCS-LDM, a novel paradigm for visual generation that decouples information complexity from scale. DCS-LDM constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space that models sample complexity through multi-level tokens and supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions and frame rates within a fixed latent representation. This latent space enables DCS-LDM to achieve a flexible computation-quality tradeoff.

Under review", "summary": "Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical data mining task often constrained by label scarcity. Consequently, current research predominantly focuses on Unsupervised Time-series Anomaly Detection (UTAD), relying on complex architectures to model normal data distributions. However, this approach often overlooks the significant performance gains available from limited anomaly labels achievable in practical scenarios. This paper challenges the premise that architectural complexity is the optimal path for TSAD. We conduct the first methodical comparison between supervised and unsupervised paradigms and introduce STAND, a streamlined supervised baseline. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that: (1) Labels matter more than models: under a limited labeling budget, simple supervised models significantly outperform complex state-of-the-art unsupervised methods; (2) Supervision yields higher returns: the performance gain from minimal supervision far exceeds that from architectural innovations; and (3) Practicality: STAND exhibits superior prediction consistency and anomaly localization compared to unsupervised counterparts. These findings advocate for a data-centric shift in TSAD research, emphasizing label utilization over purely algorithmic complexity.

However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical termination mechanism reduces the average inference time at QP = 22 by half compared to QP = 42.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u538b\u7f29\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9000\u5316\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u7ec8\u6b62\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u76f2\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709QECV\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5df2\u77e5QP\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2dQP\u53ef\u80fd\u672a\u77e5\uff1b\u5f53\u524d\u76f2\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u9000\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u540c\u538b\u7f29\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9000\u5316\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u7ef4\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9000\u5316\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u4f2a\u5f71\u53bb\u9664\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u7ec8\u6b62\u673a\u5236\u6839\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u7ea7\u522b\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4f2a\u5f71\u51cf\u5c11\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728QP=22\u65f6\uff0cPSNR\u4ece0.31dB\u63d0\u5347\u52300.65dB\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347110%\uff1b\u5206\u5c42\u7ec8\u6b62\u673a\u5236\u5728QP=22\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4QP=42\u51cf\u5c11\u4e00\u534a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76f2\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9000\u5316\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8c03\u6574\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce a novel Spatial-prioritized and Rank-aware 3D object detection (SR3D) framework for indoor point clouds, to bridge the gap between how detectors are trained and how they are evaluated. This gap stems from the lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with the ranking-based prediction selection used as inference. Such a training-inference gap hampers the model's ability to learn representations aligned with inference-time behavior. To address the limitation, SR3D consists of two components tailored to the spatial nature of point clouds during training: a novel spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, and a rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via a self-distillation paradigm.

Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP.

However, these maps lack the open-vocabulary semantic understanding required for advanced robotic interaction. Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes. These compact features also enable a language-guided pruning strategy that identifies semantic redundancy, reducing the map's Gaussian count by over 60\\% while maintaining rendering quality. Furthermore, we introduce a language-based loop detection approach that reuses these mapping features, eliminating the need for a separate detection model.

While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality. Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show that reasoning-guided conditioning improves multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over the non-reasoning baseline, confirming that explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRGE\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u878d\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u7684\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRGE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fdd\u7559MLLMs\u7684\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5c55\u5f00\u540e\u63d0\u53d6\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728MMEB\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4f7f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e864.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

By learning the underlying probability distribution of the training dataset, deep generative models, such as the diffusion model (DM), can generate high-fidelity synthetic samples that statistically resemble the training data. Such synthetic data generation can significantly enrich the size and diversity of the available training data, and more importantly, improve the robustness of downstream machine learning models in predictive tasks. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of DM for overcoming data scarcity in nuclear energy applications. By leveraging a public dataset on critical heat flux (CHF) that cover a wide range of commercial nuclear reactor operational conditions, we developed a DM that can generate an arbitrary amount of synthetic samples for augmenting of the CHF dataset. Since a vanilla DM can only generate samples randomly, we also developed a conditional DM capable of generating targeted CHF data under user-specified thermal-hydraulic conditions. The performance of the DM was evaluated based on their ability to capture empirical feature distributions and pair-wise correlations, as well as to maintain physical consistency. The results showed that both the DM and conditional DM can successfully generate realistic and physics-consistent CHF data. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification was performed to establish confidence in the generated data. The results demonstrated that the conditional DM is highly effective in augmenting CHF data while maintaining acceptable levels of uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6838\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u514b\u670d\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4e34\u754c\u70ed\u901a\u91cf(CHF)\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5b9a\u70ed\u5de5\u6c34\u529b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u6838\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5f80\u5f80\u6709\u9650\u3001\u6602\u8d35\u6216\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0b\u6e38\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8986\u76d6\u5546\u4e1a\u6838\u53cd\u5e94\u5806\u8fd0\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u516c\u5f00CHF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u70ed\u5de5\u6c34\u529b\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807CHF\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684CHF\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u589e\u5f3aCHF\u6570\u636e\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u514b\u670d\u6838\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

Labeled datasets for crop-type classification are inherently scarce and remain costly to obtain.

This mismatch induces a shift between training and test label distributions, degrading real-world generalization. To address this, we propose Dirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA), a novel method that simulates an unknown label distribution skew of the target domain proactively during model training.

Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method.

A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem.

To evaluate and enhance this capability, the pass@k metric, which measures the probability of obtaining at least one correct solution in k independent samples, has received significant attention. Its intuitive appeal has led to its adoption not only as an evaluation standard but also as a direct optimization objective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we analyze the pass@k objective, derive its gradient, and demonstrate that it is fundamentally a per-example positive reweighting of the simpler pass@1 objective. Our analysis reveals that the pass@k objective provides a vanishing learning signal in regimes where exploration is most critical. We further analyze the dynamics of \"exploration collapse\", showing that as the policy concentrates probability mass, the gap between pass@k and pass@1 diminishes. We conclude that while pass@k is a useful diagnostic tool, it may be an unsuitable direct objective for optimization. Instead, mechanisms explicitly encouraging efficient exploration could offer a more effective path forward for reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86pass@k\u6307\u6807\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5b83\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662fpass@1\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f1a\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a2\u7d22\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "motivation": "pass@k\u6307\u6807\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316LLMs\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5bfcpass@k\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4e0epass@1\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u63a2\u7d22\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0pass@k\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u96c6\u4e2d\u6982\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\u65f6\u4e0epass@1\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u4f1a\u7f29\u5c0f\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f1a\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "pass@k\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u4f46\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e94\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u9f13\u52b1\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5197\u957f\u6587\u672c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb\uff08VTIA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u826f\u6027\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u96be\u4ee5\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u6807\u8bb0\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u5176\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5ef6\u8fdfEOS\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u6765\u9690\u5f0f\u5ef6\u957f\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u6807\u8bb0\u957f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u591f\u8bf1\u5bfcLLM\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4ea7\u751f\u5197\u957f\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff1b2\uff09\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u6270\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5236\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6270\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684VTIA\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bf1\u5bfc\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5197\u957f\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity.

The problem of optimal operation can be tackled with reinforcement learning, but traditional reinforcement learning methods face challenges due to hard constraints related to quality and safety that must be strictly satisfied, and the large amount of required training data. Chemical processes often cannot provide sufficient experimental data, and while detailed dynamic models can be an alternative, their complexity makes it computationally intractable to generate the needed data. Optimal control methods, such as model predictive control, also struggle with the complexity of the underlying dynamic models. Consequently, many chemical processes rely on manually defined operation recipes combined with simple linear controllers, leading to suboptimal performance and limited flexibility.\n  In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages expert knowledge embedded in operation recipes. By using reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of these recipes and their underlying linear controllers, we achieve an optimized operation recipe. This method requires significantly less data, handles constraints more effectively, and is more interpretable than traditional reinforcement learning methods due to the structured nature of the recipes. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through simulation results of an industrial batch polymerization reactor, showing that it can approach the performance of optimal controllers while addressing the limitations of existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u64cd\u4f5c\u914d\u65b9\u4e2d\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u914d\u65b9\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u3001\u66f4\u597d\u5904\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e14\u66f4\u6613\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u5316\u5de5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u8282\u80fd\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u6210\u672c\u8282\u7ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800c\u8be6\u7ec6\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u53c8\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u64cd\u4f5c\u914d\u65b9\u4e2d\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u914d\u65b9\u53c2\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u5e95\u5c42\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u914d\u65b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u6279\u91cf\u805a\u5408\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5316\u5de5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The resulting data-informed surrogate model enables the construction of an improved observer that effectively compensates for moderate parameter uncertainty while preserving the structure of classical designs. Extensive Monte Carlo studies across diverse system dimensions show systematic and statistically significant reductions, typically exceeding 15\\%, in normalized estimation error for both open-loop and Luenberger observers.

However, due to the discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, most existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications. To address this, we take the initiative to investigate Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (UDA-VI-ReID), aiming to transfer the knowledge learned from the public data to real-world data without compromising accuracy and requiring the annotation of new samples. Specifically, we first analyze two basic challenges in UDA-VI-ReID, i.e., inter-domain modality discrepancies and intra-domain modality discrepancies. Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains. While, in the second fine-tuning stage, DSLGA designs a Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle the cross-modality alignment challenges between visible and infrared data caused by the large intra-domain modality discrepancies through a cluster-to-holistic alignment way. Finally, a new UDA-VI-ReID testing method i.e., CMDA-XD, is constructed for training and testing different UDA-VI-ReID models. A large amount of experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods under various settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578bDSLGA\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u89c1\u5149-\u7ea2\u5916\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57df\u5171\u4eab\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u5904\u7406\u8de8\u57df\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VI-ReID\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94VI-ReID\uff0c\u5c06\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u65b0\u6837\u672c\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578bDSLGA\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u7528\u57df\u5171\u4eab\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565(DSLS)\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6e90\u57df\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8de8\u57df\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u65e0\u6548\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u4f7f\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565(GAS)\u901a\u8fc7\u7c07\u5230\u6574\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u548c\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684VI-ReID\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e9b\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DSLGA\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86UDA-VI-ReID\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration. This review outlines a research agenda for clinically robust prediction-first world models that integrate generative backbones (transformers, diffusion, VAE) with causal/mechanical foundation for safe decision support in healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u52a8\u6001\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u6f14\u3001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u75c5\u5386\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86L1-L4\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u533b\u7597\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u533b\u7597\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u9886\u57df\uff1a\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\uff08\u5982\u7eb5\u5411\u80bf\u7624\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u6295\u5f71-\u8f6c\u79fb\u5efa\u6a21\u3001JEPA\u98ce\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u75c5\u5386\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u548c\u624b\u672f\u89c4\u5212\uff08\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u63a7\u5236\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fbe\u5230L1\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u548cL2\uff08\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8f83\u5c11\u8fbe\u5230L3\uff08\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u6f14\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\uff09\uff0c\u6781\u5c11\u8fbe\u5230L4\uff08\u89c4\u5212/\u63a7\u5236\uff09\u3002\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u9650\u5236\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e34\u5e8a\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4f18\u5148\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u4e3b\u5e72\uff08\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u3001\u6269\u6563\u3001VAE\uff09\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c/\u673a\u68b0\u57fa\u7840\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u5b89\u5168\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

This is significant for tasks with incremental data additions, and we show that our technique achieves speed-ups when solving to tolerance, as well as improved Bayesian optimisation performance under a fixed compute budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u89e3\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6536\u655b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6539\u8fdbGP\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u5f00\u653e\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ebf\u6027\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff08\u5982\u5171\u8f6d\u68af\u5ea6\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6216\u4ea4\u66ff\u6295\u5f71\uff09\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3cGP\u540e\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5305\u542b\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u8f83\u5c0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u89e3\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u578b\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u589e\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6dfb\u52a0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6c42\u89e3\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u589e\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6dfb\u52a0\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c42\u89e3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLA-Fool\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u8f7b\u5fae\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0cVLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "VLA-Fool\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8865\u4e01\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u7834\u574f\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u9519\u4f4d\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728LIBERO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684OpenVLA\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u8f7b\u5fae\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5177\u8eab\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5177\u6709\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u52a0\u5f3aVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing LDP mechanisms in reducing data unfairness across diverse datasets and fairness metrics, while maintaining accuracy close to that of non-private models. Moreover, compared with leading pre-processing and post-processing fairness methods, our mechanism achieves a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive attributes.

We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6b3a\u9a97\u8bc4\u4f30(MIDA)\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u540c\u6b65\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8612\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b3a\u9a97\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe(SoCoT)\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u793e\u4ea4\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bb0\u5fc6(DSEM)\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u2014\u2014\u5728\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d'\u5bdf\u8a00\u89c2\u8272'\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b3a\u9a97\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u79cd\u7f3a\u9677\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MIDA\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f3012\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90MLLM\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1SoCoT\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u548cDSEM\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5373\u4f7f\u662fGPT-4o\u7b49\u5f3a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5047\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u793e\u4ea4\u7ebf\u7d22\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4ed6\u4eba\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6216\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86MLLM\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SoCoT\u548cDSEM\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u771f\u6b63\u7c7b\u4eba\u793e\u4ea4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684MLLM\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

While traditional offline RL algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) have shown promise, they often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in environments with varying reward densities. The recently proposed Decision Transformer (DT) approach, which reframes offline RL as a sequence modelling problem, has demonstrated impressive results across various benchmarks. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of DT against traditional offline RL algorithms in dense and sparse reward settings for the ANT continous control environment. Our research investigates how these algorithms perform when faced with different reward structures, examining their ability to learn effective policies and generalize across varying levels of feedback. Through empirical analysis in the ANT environment, we found that DTs showed less sensitivity to varying reward density compared to other methods and particularly excelled with medium-expert datasets in sparse reward scenarios. In contrast, traditional value-based methods like IQL showed improved performance in dense reward settings with high-quality data, while CQL offered balanced performance across different data qualities. Additionally, DTs exhibited lower variance in performance but required significantly more computational resources compared to traditional approaches. These findings suggest that sequence modelling approaches may be more suitable for scenarios with uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods remain competitive in settings with dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728ANT\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bc6\u96c6\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DT\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u66f4\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5c06\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728ANT\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982CQL\u548cIQL\uff09\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53cd\u9988\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "DT\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u4f4e\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7279\u522b\u64c5\u957f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7b49\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1bIQL\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1bCQL\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5747\u8861\uff1bDT\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u5dee\u8f83\u4f4e\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6216\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002"}}

However, these functions often struggle to approximate the Pareto front accurately, rendering them unideal in complex, uncertain environments. This study examines selected Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms across MORL environments with discrete action and observation spaces. We aim to investigate further the limitations associated with scalarisation approaches for decision-making in multi-objective settings. Specifically, we use an outer-loop multi-policy methodology to assess the performance of a seminal single-policy MORL algorithm, MO Q-Learning implemented with linear scalarisation and Chebyshev scalarisation functions. In addition, we explore a pioneering inner-loop multi-policy algorithm, Pareto Q-Learning, which offers a more robust alternative. Our findings reveal that the performance of the scalarisation functions is highly dependent on the environment and the shape of the Pareto front.

Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints. Our work positions SAEs as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities.

In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment.

However, most existing FL research assumes consistent client participation, overlooking the practical scenario of dynamic participation (DPFL), where clients may intermittently join or leave during training. Moreover, no existing benchmarking framework systematically supports the study of DPFL-specific challenges. In this work, we present the first open-source framework explicitly designed for benchmarking FL models under dynamic client participation. Our framework provides configurable data distributions, participation patterns, and evaluation metrics tailored to DPFL scenarios. Using this platform, we benchmark four major categories of widely adopted FL models and uncover substantial performance degradation under dynamic participation. To address these challenges, we further propose Knowledge-Pool Federated Learning (KPFL), a generic plugin that maintains a shared knowledge pool across both active and idle clients. KPFL leverages dual-age and data-bias weighting, combined with generative knowledge distillation, to mitigate instability and prevent knowledge loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant impact of dynamic participation on FL performance and the effectiveness of KPFL in improving model robustness and generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53c2\u4e0e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DPFL\uff09\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86KPFL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u4e0e\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6301\u7eed\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u5165/\u9000\u51fa\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9DPFL\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u53c2\u4e0e\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7684DPFL\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86KPFL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\u6c60\u3001\u53cc\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u52a0\u6743\u4ee5\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u4e0e\u5bfc\u81f4FL\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1bKPFL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53c2\u4e0e\u5bf9\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\uff0cKPFL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Although a variety of bias-mitigation methods have been proposed, many rely on computationally expensive debiasing strategies or suffer substantial drops in model accuracy, which limits their practicality in real-world, resource-constrained settings. To address this issue, we propose a fairness-oriented low rank factorization (LRF) framework that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to improve DL model fairness. Unlike traditional SVD, which is mainly used for model compression by decomposing and reducing weight matrices, our work shows that SVD can also serve as an effective tool for fairness enhancement. Specifically, we observed that elements in the unitary matrices obtained from SVD contribute unequally to model bias across groups defined by sensitive attributes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a method, named FairLRF, that selectively removes bias-inducing elements from unitary matrices to reduce group disparities, thus enhancing model fairness. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms conventional LRF methods as well as state-of-the-art fairness-enhancing techniques. Additionally, an ablation study examines how major hyper-parameters may influence the performance of processed models.

While external control arms built from real-world data have been explored, a promising alternative is the generation of synthetic control arms using generative AI. A central challenge is the generation of time-to-event outcomes, which constitute primary endpoints in oncology and rare disease trials, but are difficult to model under censoring and small sample sizes. Existing generative approaches, largely GAN-based, are data-hungry, unstable, and rely on strong assumptions such as independent censoring. We introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) that jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes within a unified latent variable framework, without assuming independent censoring. Across synthetic and real trial datasets, we evaluate our model in two realistic scenarios: (i) data sharing under privacy constraints, where synthetic controls substitute for original data, and (ii) control-arm augmentation, where synthetic patients mitigate imbalances between treated and control groups. Our method outperforms GAN baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics, while revealing systematic miscalibration of type I error and power.

Besides grappling with the complexity of data annotation and ensuring temporal consistency, it also confronts the scarcity of relevant data and the limitations imposed by the effective range of many technologies. This research substantiates that, in aerial positioning tasks, both the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and temporal consistency (TC) metrics are of paramount importance. It is demonstrated that fully labeled data is not the optimal choice, as selecting only key data lacks the enhancement in TC, leading to failures. Hence, a teacher-student architecture, coupled with key frame selection and key frame updating algorithms, is proposed. This framework successfully performs weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional TC training in aerial tasks. The experimental results reveal that our method utilizing merely 30\\% of labeled data, concurrently elevates mIoU and temporal consistency ensuring stable localization of terrain objects.

However, in real-world scenarios, the acquisition of strictly aligned RGB-D is hindered by inherent hardware limitations (e.g., physically separate RGB-D sensors) and unavoidable calibration drift induced by mechanical vibrations or temperature variations. Consequently, existing approaches often suffer inevitable performance degradation when applied to misaligned real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Order Matching Network (MOMNet), a novel alignment-free framework that adaptively retrieves and selects the most relevant information from misaligned RGB. Specifically, our method begins with a multi-order matching mechanism, which jointly performs zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to comprehensively identify RGB information consistent with depth across multi-order feature spaces. To effectively integrate the retrieved RGB and depth, we further introduce a multi-order aggregation composed of multiple structure detectors. This strategy uses multi-order priors as prompts to facilitate the selective feature transfer from RGB to depth.

Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of its long-run behavior remains limited: existing analyses typically establish convergence in expectation or with high probability, but do not address the almost sure convergence of single trajectories. In this work, we prove that DP-SGD converges almost surely under standard smoothness assumptions, both in nonconvex and strongly convex settings, provided the step sizes satisfy some standard decaying conditions. Our analysis extends to momentum variants such as the stochastic heavy ball (DP-SHB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient (DP-NAG), where we show that careful energy constructions yield similar guarantees. These results provide stronger theoretical foundations for differentially private optimization and suggest that, despite privacy-induced distortions, the algorithm remains pathwise stable in both convex and nonconvex regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08DP-SGD\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u52a8\u91cf\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u51e0\u4e4e\u5fc5\u7136\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6790\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u671f\u671b\u6216\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u6536\u655b\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9DP-SGD\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5efa\u7acb\u671f\u671b\u6216\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5355\u6761\u8f68\u8ff9\u51e0\u4e4e\u5fc5\u7136\u6536\u655b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u5176\u957f\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6ee1\u8db3\u8870\u51cf\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6b65\u957f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eDP-SGD\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u548c\u5f3a\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u51e0\u4e4e\u5fc5\u7136\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u52a8\u91cf\u53d8\u4f53\u5982DP-SHB\u548cDP-NAG\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86DP-SGD\u53ca\u5176\u52a8\u91cf\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u6b65\u957f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u51e0\u4e4e\u5fc5\u7136\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5931\u771f\uff0cDP-SGD\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u51f8\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u533a\u57df\u90fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8def\u5f84\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Most Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based CZSL methods focus on disentangling attributes and objects by leveraging the global semantic representation obtained from the image encoder. However, this representation has limited representational capacity and do not allow for complete disentanglement of the two. To this end, we propose CAMS, which aims to extract semantic features from visual features and perform semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, thereby improving generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions. Specifically, CAMS designs a Gated Cross-Attention that captures fine-grained semantic features from the high-level image encoding blocks of CLIP through a set of latent units, while adaptively suppressing background and other irrelevant information. Subsequently, it conducts Multi-Space Disentanglement to achieve disentanglement of attribute and object semantics. Experiments on three popular benchmarks (MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA) demonstrate that CAMS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

To validate our approach, we both develop a simulation environment and collect a real-world dataset of soft objects and corresponding ground truth images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Yet, most existing methods suffer from depth estimates that are inconsistent between overlapping images. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel geometry-guided method for calibrated, time-synchronized multi-camera rigs that predicts dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth. Given the intrinsic and relative orientation parameters, a first depth map is predicted per image and the so-derived 3D points from all images are projected onto a shared unit cylinder, establishing neighborhood relations across different images. This produces a 2D position map for every image, where each pixel is assigned its projected position on the cylinder. Based on these position maps, we apply an explicit, non-learned spatial attention that aggregates features among pixels across images according to their distances on the cylinder, to predict a final depth map per image. Evaluated on the DDAD and nuScenes datasets, our approach improves the consistency of depth estimates across images and the overall depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u73af\u89c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u5706\u67f1\u4f53\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u805a\u5408\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u73af\u89c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cd\u53e0\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0b\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u5b9a\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u521d\u59cb\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u76843D\u70b9\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u5355\u4f4d\u5706\u67f1\u4f53\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u90bb\u57df\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4f4d\u7f6e\u56fe\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6839\u636e\u5706\u67f1\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u805a\u5408\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u7ec8\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728DDAD\u548cnuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u73af\u89c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.\n  Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.\n  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.\n  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408Vision Transformer\u548cGraph Neural Networks\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u8179\u8154\u955c\u80c6\u56ca\u5207\u9664\u672f\u4e2d\u809d\u80c6\u56ca\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u906e\u6321\u3001\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u7ec6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u3001\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u7f55\u89c1\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u624b\u672f\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1\uff09\u9759\u6001k\u8fd1\u90bb\u56fe\u4e0eGCNII\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\uff1b2\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e0eGAT\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u62d3\u6251\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u5728Endoscapes-Seg50\u548cCholecSeg8k\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728mIoU\u4e0a\u63d0\u53477-8%\uff0c\u5728mDice\u4e0a\u63d0\u53476%\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7ec6\u8584\u3001\u7f55\u89c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u57fa\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ViT\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u56fe\u57fa\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8179\u8154\u955c\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment.

Existing methods mainly mine references from support images as meta guidance. However, due to intra-class variations among visual representations, the meta information extracted from support images cannot produce accurate guidance to segment untrained classes. In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching.

However, complex scenes can consist of millions of Gaussians, resulting in high storage and memory requirements that limit the viability of 3D-GS on devices with limited resources. Current techniques for compressing these pretrained models by pruning Gaussians rely on combining heuristics to determine which Gaussians to remove. At high compression ratios, these pruned scenes suffer from heavy degradation of visual fidelity and loss of foreground details. In this paper, we propose a principled sensitivity pruning score that preserves visual fidelity and foreground details at significantly higher compression ratios than existing approaches. It is computed as a second-order approximation of the reconstruction error on the training views with respect to the spatial parameters of each Gaussian. Additionally, we propose a multi-round prune-refine pipeline that can be applied to any pretrained 3D-GS model without changing its training pipeline. After pruning 90% of Gaussians, a substantially higher percentage than previous methods, our PUP 3D-GS pipeline increases average rendering speed by 3.56$\\times$ while retaining more salient foreground information and achieving higher image quality metrics than existing techniques on scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u524d\u666f\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4e2a\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u4e0b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u524d\u666f\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u9636\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9ad8\u65af\u7a7a\u95f4\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u8f6e\u526a\u679d-\u7cbe\u70bc\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76843D-GS\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u526a\u966490%\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u540e\uff0c\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53473.56\u500d\uff0c\u5728Mip-NeRF 360\u3001Tanks & Temples\u548cDeep Blending\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u524d\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec33D-GS\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u524d\u666f\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task.

Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLA-Pruner\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u663e\u8457\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u6027\uff08\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVLA-Pruner\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6807\u51c6\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u586b\u5145\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u89e3\u7801\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6807\u51c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eVLA-Pruner\u5728\u591a\u79cdVLA\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "VLA-Pruner\u901a\u8fc7\u5339\u914dVLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728VLA\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Although general video prediction models have achieved remarkable performance in standard scenarios, occlusion is still an inherent challenge in video prediction. We hypothesize that providing explicit information about motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps) will enable video prediction models to perform better in situations with occlusion and the background motion. To investigate this, we present the first systematic study dedicated to occluded video prediction. We use a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to predict future frames, but modify this to incorporate information from depth and point-flow. We evaluate this model in a controlled setting on both synthetic and real-world datasets with not only appearance-based metrics but also Wasserstein distances on object masks, which can effectively measure the motion distribution of the prediction. We find that when the prediction model is assisted with point flow and depth, it performs better in occluded scenarios and predicts more accurate background motion compared to models without the help of these modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u70b9\u6d41\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u906e\u6321\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u8fd0\u52a8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u70b9\u6d41\uff09\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u906e\u6321\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u8fd0\u52a8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u5e27\uff0c\u4f46\u4fee\u6539\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u878d\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u70b9\u6d41\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u8c61\u63a9\u7801\u4e0a\u7684Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u6709\u6548\u6d4b\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u4ee5\u70b9\u6d41\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u6ca1\u6709\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u6001\u5e2e\u52a9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u70b9\u6d41\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f5c\u8005\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset.

Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSemCLIP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u91ca\u4e49\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbCLIP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u3001\u91ca\u4e49\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u548c\u91ca\u4e49\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5426\u5b9a\u4f1a\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u8bcd\u6c47\u53d8\u5316\u5f7b\u5e95\u6539\u53d8\u542b\u4e49\uff0c\u800c\u91ca\u4e49\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u540c\u4f46\u542b\u4e49\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSemCLIP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u91ca\u4e49\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684CLIP\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u91ca\u4e49\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\uff1b3\uff09\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u3001\u91ca\u4e49\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u8bad\u7ec3CLIP\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728CC-Neg\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u539f\u59cb\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece68.1%\u63d0\u5347\u523078.1%\uff1b\u5728Sugarcrepe++\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u7528\u5426\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSemCLIP\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8eCLIP\u3002", "conclusion": "SemCLIP\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301CLIP\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e0e\u5426\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

It is based on a guided image method, which transfers image characteristics from a guidance image to the target image. Using state-of-the-art guided methods, low-light images lack sufficient characteristics for this purpose due to their high noise level and low brightness, rendering suboptimal/not significantly improved images in the process.

In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims.

Despite considerable progress in multi-camera tracking algorithms, tracking gymnasts presents unique challenges: (i) due to space restrictions, only a limited number of cameras can be installed in the gymnastics stadium; and (ii) due to variations in lighting, background, uniforms, and occlusions, multi-camera gymnast detection may fail in certain views and only provide valid detections from two opposing views. These factors complicate the accurate determination of a gymnast's 3D trajectory using conventional multi-camera triangulation. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate gymnastics domain knowledge into our tracking solution. Given that a gymnast's 3D center typically lies within a predefined vertical plane during \\revised{much of their} performance, we can apply a ray-plane intersection to generate coplanar 3D trajectory candidates for opposing-view detections. More specifically, we propose a novel cascaded data association (DA) paradigm that employs triangulation to generate 3D trajectory candidates when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resort to the ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient.

This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.\n  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.\n  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70\\% and 4.27\\% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u4f7f\u7528k-NN\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u9700150\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u523091.3%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u4f7f\u5f97\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5185\u5bb9\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u9700\u8981\u9891\u7e41\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u800c\u53d8\u5f97\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528k-NN\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff08\u6bcf\u7c7b\u4ec5150\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523091.3%\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad85.2\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u5728\u6765\u6e90\u5f52\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cAUC\u548cOSCR\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8614.70%\u548c4.27%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u73af\u5883\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u53d6\u8bc1\u5f52\u56e0\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

In this work, we extend the Earth Observation Gaussian Splatting (EOGS) framework to propose EOGS++, a novel method tailored for satellite imagery that directly operates on raw high-resolution panchromatic data without requiring external preprocessing. Furthermore, leveraging optical flow techniques we embed bundle adjustment directly within the training process, avoiding reliance on external optimization tools while improving camera pose estimation. We also introduce several improvements to the original implementation, including early stopping and TSDF post-processing, all contributing to sharper reconstructions and better geometric accuracy. Experiments on the IARPA 2016 and DFC2019 datasets demonstrate that EOGS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction quality and effi- ciency, outperforming the original EOGS method and other NeRF-based methods while maintaining the computational advantages of Gaussian Splatting.

Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \\textbf{SAM2} for \\textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\\mathcal{J}$\\&$\\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\\mathcal{J}$\\&$\\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.\n  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers. To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class. For inference, we utilize a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach to improve classification performance, particularly for rare classes.

While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories.

Furthermore, we introduce instance mask denoising to prune learnable Gaussian primitives by filtering out redundant background regions, reducing inference computation at each denoising step.

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT.

Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "TriDiff-4D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u76844D\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u4e09\u5e73\u9762\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u76844D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u610f\u957f\u5ea6\u76844D\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u67094D\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u53ef\u63a74D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u83033D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u548c\u5bf9\u5e94\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u6dfb\u52a0\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u957f\u5ea6\u76844D\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e603D\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "TriDiff-4D\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u51e0\u5c0f\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5230\u51e0\u79d2\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u76843D\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "conclusion": "TriDiff-4D\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u76844D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a4D\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization.

Such a two-system thinking mechanism allows us to efficiently allocate cognitive resources, enabling quick decision-making for straightforward issues while reserving deeper analytical thinking for more intricate challenges. However, existing reasoning-oriented visual language models (VLMs), whether trained with explicit chain-of-thought annotations or rule-based RL rewards, mainly pursue lengthy, detailed reasoning chains, which often lead to excessive computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking. Despite its simplicity, our model, named DualMindVLM, significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models, while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDualMindVLM\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u81ea\u52a8\u5207\u6362\u5feb\u901f\u601d\u7ef4\u548c\u6162\u901f\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u8ffd\u6c42\u5197\u957f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u601d\u8003\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u5feb\u901f\u6216\u6162\u901f\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528GRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u3002", "result": "DualMindVLM\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6781\u9ad8\u7684token\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b80\u5355RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation.

For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate \"ground-truth\" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).", "AI": {"tldr": "NoPo-Avatar\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u6216\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u76843D\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u59ff\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u51c6\u786e\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNoPo-Avatar\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u5316\u8eab\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u53bb\u9664\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728THuman2.0\u3001XHuman\u548cHuGe100K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0cNoPo-Avatar\u4e0d\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}
