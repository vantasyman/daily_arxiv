This method often produces visual artifacts known as floaters--nearly transparent, disconnected elements that drift in space away from the actual surface. This geometric inaccuracy undermines the reliability of these models for practical applications, which is critical. To address this issue, we introduce TIDI-GS, a new training framework designed to eliminate these floaters. A key benefit of our approach is that it functions as a lightweight plugin for the standard 3DGS pipeline, requiring no major architectural changes and adding minimal overhead to the training process. The core of our method is a floater pruning algorithm--TIDI--that identifies and removes floaters based on several criteria: their consistency across multiple viewpoints, their spatial relationship to other elements, and an importance score learned during training. The framework includes a mechanism to preserve fine details, ensuring that important high-frequency elements are not mistakenly removed. This targeted cleanup is supported by a monocular depth-based loss function that helps improve the overall geometric structure of the scene. Our experiments demonstrate that TIDI-GS improves both the perceptual quality and geometric integrity of reconstructions, transforming them into robust digital assets, suitable for high-fidelity applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing academic methods focus narrowly on drift detection without addressing diagnosis or remediation, and they ignore the hierarchical structure inherent in supply chain data. What retailers need is an end-to-end system that detects drift early, explains its root causes, and automatically corrects affected models.

The Directly Denoising Diffusion Model (DDDM) mitigates these inefficiencies by replacing stochastic reverse MCMC updates with deterministic denoising step, substantially reducing inference time. Yet, the theoretical underpinnings of such deterministic updates have remained opaque. In this work, we provide a principled reinterpretation of DDDM through the lens of the Reverse Transition Kernel (RTK) framework by Huang et al. 2024, unifying deterministic and stochastic diffusion under a shared probabilistic formalism. By expressing the DDDM reverse process as an approximate kernel operator, we show that the direct denoising process implicitly optimizes a structured transport map between noisy and clean samples. This perspective elucidates why deterministic denoising achieves efficient inference. Beyond theoretical clarity, this reframing resolves several long-standing bottlenecks in molecular diffusion. The RTK view ensures numerical stability by enforcing well-conditioned reverse kernels, improves sample consistency by eliminating stochastic variance, and enables scalable and symmetry-preserving denoisers that respect SE(3) equivariance.

This work introduces a Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation framework, a novel method for generating counterfactual explanations in time series classification tasks that remain consistent with underlying physical principles. Applied to solar energetic particles (SEP) forecasting, this framework achieves over 80% reduction in Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance increasing the proximity, produces counterfactual explanations with higher sparsity, and reduces runtime by nearly 50% compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as DiCE. Beyond numerical improvements, this framework ensures that generated counterfactual explanations are physically plausible and actionable in scientific domains.

To address this gap, this paper presents an adaptive CV framework for the entire life-cycle of quality model maintenance.

Meta-learning, which enables models to adapt quickly to new data with few examples, offers a promising alternative for mitigating these challenges. Here, we systematically compare TDL with fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-learning algorithms to assess their ability to address data shift in time-series classification. We introduce a controlled, task-oriented seismic benchmark (SeisTask) and show that meta-learning typically achieves faster and more stable adaptation with reduced overfitting in data-scarce regimes and smaller model architectures. As data availability and model capacity increase, its advantages diminish, with TDL with fine-tuning performing comparably. Finally, we examine how task diversity influences meta-learning and find that alignment between training and test distributions, rather than diversity alone, drives performance gains.

Applying BWSSL to masked video modeling remains relatively underexplored and must handle spatiotemporal context and long-range temporal structure. More broadly, analyses that compare BWSSL and end-to-end training in terms of learning dynamics and depth-wise representation development remain sparse. We apply blockwise learning to a masked autoencoding video vision transformer by partitioning the encoder into blocks, each of which is optimized with a local masked reconstruction loss.

It achieves SOTA performance among open-source models of comparable scale across challenging benchmarks in mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation -- even outperforming several larger models. We begin by critically reexamining a widely adopted distillation paradigm in the community: SFT on teacher-generated responses, also known as sequence-level distillation. Although a series of recent works following this scheme have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and strong empirical performance, they are primarily grounded in the SFT perspective. Consequently, these approaches focus predominantly on designing heuristic rules for SFT data filtering, while largely overlooking the core principle of distillation itself -- enabling the student model to learn the teacher's full output distribution so as to inherit its generalization capability. Specifically, we identify three critical limitations in current practice: i) Inadequate representation of the teacher's sequence-level distribution; ii) Misalignment between the teacher's output distribution and the student's learning capacity; and iii) Exposure bias arising from teacher-forced training versus autoregressive inference. In summary, these shortcomings reflect a systemic absence of explicit teacher-student interaction throughout the distillation process, leaving the essence of distillation underexploited. To address these issues, we propose several methodological innovations that collectively form an enhanced sequence-level distillation training pipeline. Remarkably, DASD-4B-Thinking obtains competitive results using only 448K training samples -- an order of magnitude fewer than those employed by most existing open-source efforts.

However, due to their massive number of parameters, directly adopting full-parameter fine-tuning leads to pronounced training difficulties, such as excessive GPU memory consumption and high computational costs, which result in extremely limited exploration of large-scale models in existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed WEFT, which efficiently adapts large-scale foundation models to ORSIs segmentation tasks by leveraging the guidance of wavelet experts. Specifically, we introduce a task-specific wavelet expert extractor to model wavelet experts from different perspectives and dynamically regulate their outputs, thereby generating trainable features enriched with task-specific information for subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we construct an expert-guided conditional adapter that first enhances the fine-grained perception of frozen features for specific tasks by injecting trainable features, and then iteratively updates the information of both types of feature, allowing for efficient fine-tuning.

To this end, we focus on the General Scene Adaptation (GSA-VLN) task, aiming to learn generalized navigation ability by introducing diverse environments and inconsistent intructions.Towards this task, when facing unseen environments and instructions, the challenge mainly lies in how to enable the agent to dynamically produce generalized strategies during the navigation process.

However, these methods rely on proxy-based expansion, which tends to generate samples clustered near class proxies, failing to simulate the broad and distant domain shifts encountered in practice. To alleviate the problem, we propose CenterPolar, a novel SDG-DML framework that dynamically expands and constrains domain distributions to learn a generalizable DML model for wider target domain distributions.

Traditional deep learning models either process frames independently, ignoring temporal information, or rely on memory-based feature propagation, which accumulates error over time. Methods: We propose Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as a temporal cue to ensure stable and consistent segmentation of myocardium across frames. Our method leverages a point-tracking module trained on a synthetic echocardiography dataset to track key anatomical landmarks across video sequences. These tracked trajectories provide an explicit motion-aware signal that guides segmentation, reducing drift and eliminating the need for memory-based feature accumulation. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal smoothing loss to further enhance temporal consistency across frames. Results: We evaluate our approach on both public and private echocardiography datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Point-Seg has statistically similar accuracy in terms of Dice to state-of-the-art segmentation models in high quality echo data, while it achieves better segmentation accuracy in lower quality echo with improved temporal stability.

This challenge is further exacerbated by inconsistencies in response across domains due to interface coupling and by disparities in learning difficulty across fluid and solid regions, leading to instability during prediction. To address these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Solver (HGATSolver). HGATSolver encodes the system as a heterogeneous graph, embedding physical structure directly into the model via distinct node and edge types for fluid, solid, and interface regions.

In EIUR, standard robust learning can converge stably yet form high-confidence, systematically wrong beliefs.\n  We propose metacognitive regulation as a practical response: a second, introspective control loop that infers experience credibility from endogenous evidence in the learner's internal dynamics.

In reinforcement learning, it enables calibrated skepticism and recovery under systematically corrupted rewards. In supervised learning, it exposes a critical dissociation: performance recovery does not imply epistemic recovery.

In this paper, we first systematically investigate the effects of ``one-to-many'' supervision and reveal a surprising insight that performance gains are driven not by the sheer quantity of supervision, but by the diversity of the assignment strategies employed.

Multi-modal LLM (MLLM) can understand images, but they do not have sufficient domain knowledge. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-stage progressive training strategy to train a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, and constructs a standard evaluation system to validate the performance of DICModel. Specifically, this work first synthesizes about 7K image-text pairs by combining the Mermaid tool and LLMs, which are used for the first-stage supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) of DICModel. Then, ICT-domain experts manually annotate about 2K image-text pairs for the second-stage SFT of DICModel. Finally, experts and LLMs jointly synthesize about 1.5K visual question answering data for the instruction-based SFT. Experimental results indicate that our DICModel with only 7B parameters performs better than other state-of-the-art models with 32B parameters. Compared to the SOTA models with 7B and 32B parameters, our DICModel increases the BLEU metric by approximately 56.8% and 20.8%, respectively. On the objective questions constructed by ICT domain experts, our DICModel outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% in terms of accuracy rate.

In this work, we provide an alternative by introducing \\simmerge{}, \\emph{a predictive merge-selection method} that selects the best merge using inexpensive, task-agnostic similarity signals between models.

To leverage this distribution of information, we apply an attentive probing mechanism that dynamically fuses representations from all layers of a Vision Transformer. This mechanism learns to identify the most relevant layers for a target task and combines low-level structural cues with high-level semantic abstractions. Across 20 diverse datasets and multiple pretrained foundation models, our method achieves consistent, substantial gains over standard linear probes.

In this work, we applied DeepONets in the context of process modeling for adsorption technologies, to assess their feasibility as surrogates for cyclic adsorption process simulation and optimization. The goal is to accelerate convergence of cyclic processes such as Temperature-Vacuum Swing Adsorption (TVSA), which require repeated solution of transient PDEs, which are computationally expensive.

To evaluate functional generalization under these conditions, we construct a mixed training dataset composed of heterogeneous initial conditions and train DeepONets to approximate the corresponding solution operators.

We transform this complex field to the frequency domain and train a low-capacity autoencoder to reconstruct normalized spectra. Channels whose spectra are reconstructed with high fidelity are interpreted as lying close to a low-dimensional manifold captured by the autoencoder and are therefore more compressible; conversely, channels with low fidelity are retained as they encode information that cannot be compactly represented by the learned manifold.

Image super-resolution is a vital technology closely related to real-world applications, as it enhances the quality of existing images.

This paper proposes two methods to enhance high-frequency details in super-resolution images: a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and a repeated upscaling and downscaling process. Total loss with our detail loss guides a model by separately generating and controlling super-resolution and detail images. This approach allows the model to focus more effectively on high-frequency components, resulting in improved super-resolution images. Additionally, repeated upscaling and downscaling amplify the effectiveness of the detail loss by extracting diverse information from multiple low-resolution features.

We study this problem from a mechanistic perspective based on model circuits--structured interaction pathways that govern how predictions are formed.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUD reliably separates intrinsically easy and hard samples, and remains stable across unlearning methods. We identify key circuit-level patterns that reveal a mechanistic signature of difficulty: easy-to-unlearn samples are associated with shorter, shallower interactions concentrated in earlier-to-intermediate parts of the original model, whereas hard samples rely on longer and deeper pathways closer to late-stage computation.

Adapting these generalist video models to driving domains has shown promise but typically requires massive domain-specific data and costly fine-tuning. We propose an efficient adaptation framework that converts generalist video diffusion models into controllable driving world models with minimal supervision. The key idea is to decouple motion learning from appearance synthesis. First, the model is adapted to predict structured motion in a simplified form: videos of skeletonized agents and scene elements, focusing learning on physical and social plausibility. Then, the same backbone is reused to synthesize realistic RGB videos conditioned on these motion sequences, effectively \"dressing\" the motion with texture and lighting. This two-stage process mirrors a reasoning-rendering paradigm: first infer dynamics, then render appearance. Our experiments show this decoupled approach is exceptionally efficient: adapting SVD, we match prior SOTA models with less than 6% of their compute. Scaling to LTX, our MAD-LTX model outperforms all open-source competitors, and supports a comprehensive suite of text, ego, and object controls.

This reveals a clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within the same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. The most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets, and persist after open-label alignment, indicating that domain shift dominates in the hardest regimes. To disentangle domain shift from label mismatch, we compare closed-label transfer with an open-label protocol that maps predicted classes to the nearest target label using CLIP similarity.

Instead, we would like to construct an alternative training set from a large-scale data server so that a competitive model can be obtained. For this problem, because the target domain usually exhibits distinct modes (i.e., semantic clusters representing data distribution), if the training set does not contain these target modes, the model performance would be compromised. While prior existing works improve algorithms iteratively, our research explores the often-overlooked potential of optimizing the structure of the data server. Inspired by the hierarchical nature of web search engines, we introduce a hierarchical data server, together with a bipartite mode matching algorithm (BMM) to align source and target modes. For each target mode, we look in the server data tree for the best mode match, which might be large or small in size. Through bipartite matching, we aim for all target modes to be optimally matched with source modes in a one-on-one fashion. Compared with existing training set search algorithms, we show that the matched server modes constitute training sets that have consistently smaller domain gaps with the target domain across object re-identification (re-ID) and detection tasks. Consequently, models trained on our searched training sets have higher accuracy than those trained otherwise.

However, most existing systems focus narrowly on object classification within fixed visual scopes and apply rule-based heuristics to determine intrusion status, often overlooking targets that pose latent intrusion risks. Anticipating such risks requires the cognition of spatial context and temporal dynamics for the object of interest (OOI), which presents challenges for conventional visual models. To facilitate deep intrusion perception, we introduce a novel benchmark, CogRail, which integrates curated open-source datasets with cognitively driven question-answer annotations to support spatio-temporal reasoning and prediction. Building upon this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art visual-language models (VLMs) using multimodal prompts to identify their strengths and limitations in this domain. Furthermore, we fine-tune VLMs for better performance and propose a joint fine-tuning framework that integrates three core tasks, position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis, facilitating effective adaptation of general-purpose foundation models into specialized models tailored for cognitive intrusion perception. Extensive experiments reveal that current large-scale multimodal models struggle with the complex spatial-temporal reasoning required by the cognitive intrusion perception task, underscoring the limitations of existing foundation models in this safety-critical domain. In contrast, our proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands, highlighting the advantages of structured multi-task learning in improving both accuracy and interpretability.

Traditional methods require extensive manual annotation, while existing self-supervised approaches are computationally demanding and ill-suited for long sequences due to memory constraints and temporal error propagation. We introduce a highly efficient, self-supervised method that reframes animal identification as a global clustering task rather than a sequential tracking problem. Our approach assumes a known, fixed number of individuals within a single video -- a common scenario in practice -- and requires only bounding box detections and the total count. By sampling pairs of frames, using a frozen pre-trained backbone, and employing a self-bootstrapping mechanism with the Hungarian algorithm for in-batch pseudo-label assignment, our method learns discriminative features without identity labels. We adapt a Binary Cross Entropy loss from vision-language models, enabling state-of-the-art accuracy ($>$97\\%) while consuming less than 1 GB of GPU memory per batch -- an order of magnitude less than standard contrastive methods. Evaluated on challenging real-world datasets (3D-POP pigeons and 8-calves feeding videos), our framework matches or surpasses supervised baselines trained on over 1,000 labeled frames, effectively removing the manual annotation bottleneck.

To address this, we propose SCE-SLAM, an end-to-end SLAM system that maintains scale consistency through scene coordinate embeddings, which are learned patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under a canonical scale reference. The framework consists of two key modules: geometry-guided aggregation that leverages 3D spatial proximity to propagate scale information from historical observations through geometry-modulated attention, and scene coordinate bundle adjustment that anchors current estimates to the reference scale through explicit 3D coordinate constraints decoded from the scene coordinate embeddings.

This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion.

Optimization-based methods typically follow a two-stage pipeline, first detecting 2D keypoints in each view and then associating these detections across views to triangulate the 3D pose. Existing methods rely on mere pairwise associations to model this correspondence problem, treating global consistency between views (i.e., cycle consistency) as a soft constraint. Yet, reconciling these constraints for multiple views becomes brittle when spurious associations propagate errors. We thus propose COMPOSE, a novel framework that formulates multi-view pose correspondence matching as a hypergraph partitioning problem rather than through pairwise association. While the complexity of the resulting integer linear program grows exponentially in theory, we introduce an efficient geometric pruning strategy to substantially reduce the search space.
