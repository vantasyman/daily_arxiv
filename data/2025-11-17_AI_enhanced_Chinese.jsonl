This paper asks a precise, testable version of the \"runaway growth\" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7814\u7a76AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u65e0\u9650\u589e\u957f\uff08\u5931\u63a7\u589e\u957f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4ec0\u4e48\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u529b\u4f1a\u65e0\u9650\u589e\u957f\uff08\u5931\u63a7\u589e\u957f\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4ec0\u4e48\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6392\u9664\u8fd9\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u66ff\u4ee3\u731c\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9012\u5f52\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5efa\u8bbe\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u9650\u5236\u5b9a\u4e49\u670d\u52a1\u5305\u7edc\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5185\u6e90\u6027\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u533a\u5206\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u4e9a\u4e34\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5c06\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5e8f\u5217\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5931\u63a7\u4e0e\u975e\u5947\u5f02\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u529f\u7387\u9650\u5236\u3001\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u8282\u6d41\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u95e8\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u63aa\u65bd\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e86\u731c\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6216\u6392\u9664AI\u5947\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u8bc6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177ColoWorkflow\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u521b\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u624b\u672f\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u521b\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u624b\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5927\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u9661\u5ced\u548c\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u5f71\u54cd\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u57f9\u8bad\u548c\u6539\u5584\u624b\u672f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5fb7\u5c14\u83f2\u6cd5\u8fbe\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1ColoWorkflow\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8179\u8154\u955c\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u95f4\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8fbe\u6210\u4e8610\u4e2a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u65e0\u5173\u9636\u6bb5\u548c34\u4e2a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7279\u5b9a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u572854\u4e2a\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u95f4\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e2d\u7b49\uff08\u9636\u6bb5K=0.71\uff0c\u6b65\u9aa4K=0.66\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "ColoWorkflow\u4e3a\u5fae\u521b\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u624b\u672f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u673a\u6784\u95f4\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u8bc6\u522b\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57f9\u8bad\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u80fd\u529b\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u63a8\u8fdb\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($\u03c1$) and head-tail ratio ($\u03b7$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy. Experiments across six benchmark datasets show that LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across a wide range of imbalance regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLT-Soups\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c3e\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u727a\u7272\u5934\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u5e38\u5448\u73b0\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5c3e\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u727a\u7272\u5934\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5934\u5c3e\u7c7b\u6bd4\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd9\u79cd\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLT-Soups\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u53d6\u5e73\u5747\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5934\u7c7b\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4ec5\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u5934\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLT-Soups\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u5e03\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u76f8\u6bd4PEFT\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6743\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LT-Soups\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u5c3e\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Here, we introduce a matrix-free perspective, using trace estimation to rapidly analyze the empirical, finite-width NTK. This enables fast computation of the NTK's trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment. We provide numerical recipes based on the Hutch++ trace estimator with provably fast convergence guarantees. In addition, we show that, due to the structure of the NTK, one can compute the trace using only forward- or reverse-mode automatic differentiation, not requiring both modes. We show these so-called one-sided estimators can outperform Hutch++ in the low-sample regime, especially when the gap between the model state and parameter count is large.

Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings.

Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens.

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6b63\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6b63\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6b63\u63d0\u793a\u5173\u6ce8\u7c7b\u5185\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u5f3a\u8c03\u7c7b\u522b\u8fb9\u754c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u76d1\u7763\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u652f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u5f3a\u8c03\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4e0d\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u5f80\u5f80\u5305\u542b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u975eID\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6355\u83b7\u91cd\u53e0\u6216\u8bef\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6b63\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\uff1b2. \u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u6b63\u63d0\u793a\u805a\u7126\u7c7b\u5185\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u7a81\u51fa\u7c7b\u522b\u8fb9\u754c\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3. \u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u805a\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5e76\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u652f\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u548cImageNet-1K\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u516b\u4e2aOOD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset.

Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed a variational quantum kernel framework utilizing resource-efficient ans\u00e4tze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our classically simulated results show that the proposed quantum kernel demonstrated a clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning.

However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u4e92\u8865\u84b8\u998f\uff08HCD\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982ViT\u5230ResNet18\uff09\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u5171\u4eablogits\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50logit\u89e3\u8026\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u540c\u6784\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982Vision Transformer\u5230ResNet18\uff09\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f02\u6784KD\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56logit\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "HCD\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5377\u79ef\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6c60\u5316\u5904\u7406\u5b66\u751f\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u5012\u6570\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u62fc\u63a5\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5668\uff08CFM\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u5171\u4eablogits\uff1b4\uff09\u5b50logit\u89e3\u8026\u84b8\u998f\uff08SDD\uff09\u5c06\u5171\u4eablogits\u5212\u5206\u4e3an\u4e2a\u5b50logits\uff1b5\uff09\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff08OL\uff09\u786e\u4fdd\u5b50logit\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982CUB200\uff09\u548cImageNet-1K\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHCD\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684KD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HCD\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u5b66\u751f\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u52bf\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Reddy"], "title": "SURFACEBENCH: Can Self-Evolving LLMs Find the Equations of 3D Scientific Surfaces?", "comment": null, "summary": "Equation discovery from data is a core challenge in machine learning for science, requiring the recovery of concise symbolic expressions that govern complex physical and geometric phenomena. Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench", "AI": {"tldr": "SurfaceBench\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u66f2\u9762\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b183\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d615\u7c7b\u7b26\u53f7\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u663e\u5f0f\u3001\u9690\u5f0f\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u7a0b\u53d1\u73b0\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6807\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5339\u914d\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u80fd\u591f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b183\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d615\u79cd\u7b26\u53f7\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u663e\u5f0f\u3001\u9690\u5f0f\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e09\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7b26\u53f7\u7ec4\u5408\u62b5\u6297LLM\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5982\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u867d\u7136\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u51fd\u6570\u65cf\u4e0a\u5076\u5c14\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u66f2\u9762\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u3002SurfaceBench\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "conclusion": "SurfaceBench\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u63a5\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66\u5f52\u7eb3\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment.

While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations.

Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues.

Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations. Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations. This inductive bias distinguishes FlowPath from prior unconstrained learnable path models. Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures.

In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u96c6\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u56de\u62a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56de\u62a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u56de\u62a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u6536\u96c6\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6536\u96c6\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u65b9\u5dee\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002"}}

Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an \"Eigenbasis Score\", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce.

While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DMC\u548cDMC-OT\u4e24\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u539f\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5230\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u56de\u653e\u4e2d\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "method": "DMC\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u51bb\u7ed3\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\uff1bDMC-OT\u5728DMC\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6821\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u5185\u5b58\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u3001Imagenet-R\u3001CUB-200\u548cUCF-101\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDMC\u548cDMC-OT\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0cDMC-OT\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5c06\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e861.80%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6821\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86CLIP\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms.

We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPhase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76f8\u4f4d\u5e73\u6ed1\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u9891LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891LLMs\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5e27\u65f6\u5e8f\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ffb\u8f6c\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u76f8\u5173\u5e27\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001RoPE\u6269\u5c55\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u9006\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u65f6\u95f4\u6838\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5e27\u7ea7\u6ce2\u7eb9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPAS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u805a\u5408\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5934\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u6ed1\u65f6\u95f4\u6838\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u76f8\u4f4d\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540ctoken\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "PAS\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u5347\u7ea7\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder.

However, existing approaches typically rely on domain-specific knowledge to construct these graphs, limiting their applicability to new tasks. Other graph-based approaches create graphs dynamically during exploration but struggle to fully utilize them, because they have problems passing the information in the graphs to newly visited states. Additionally, current GCHRL methods face challenges such as sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation. This paper proposes a solution to these issues by developing a graph encoder-decoder to evaluate unseen states. Our proposed method, Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), can be incorporated into any existing GCHRL method when operating in environments with primarily symmetric and reversible transitions to enhance performance across this class of problems. We show that the graph encoder-decoder can be effectively implemented using a network trained on the state graph generated during exploration.

However, conventional approaches are computationally expensive and lack a high-quality labeled dataset for multi-joint applications. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework that estimates muscle activations and forces directly from kinematics. The framework employs a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers to capture inter-joint coordination, enabling each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. By embedding multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions into the loss function, our Physics-Informed MJCA-BiGRU (PI-MJCA-BiGRU) delivers physiologically consistent predictions without labeled data while enabling time-efficient inference. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6PI-MJCA-BiGRU\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u76f4\u63a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u591a\u5173\u8282\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u5173\u8282\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65f6\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u529b\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u5173\u8282\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\u5c42\u6765\u6355\u6349\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u5173\u8282\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u8026\u5408\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u529b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4e14MJCA\u6a21\u5757\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PI-MJCA-BiGRU\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u751f\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u529b\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u8bbe\u5907\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset.

However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "PROMISE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5b8c\u6574\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPROMISE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u878d\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u660e\u786e\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cPROMISE\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PROMISE\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5c42\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Accepted as an Oral presentation at AAAI 2026. For code and dataset, see https://zane-zyqiu.github.io/EmoVid", "summary": "Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model.

However, it is hampered by the flaw that current approaches are forced to accept a compromise between performance and privacy: \\textit{transmitting embedding representations risks sensitive data leakage, while sharing only abstract cluster prototypes leads to diminished model accuracy}. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived. The framework offers two distinct modes to suit different needs. SPP-FGC is designed as an efficient one-shot method that completes its task in a single communication round, ideal for rapid analysis. For more complex, unstructured data like images, SPP-FGC+ employs an iterative process where clients and the server collaboratively refine feature representations to achieve superior downstream performance.

Code will be available", "summary": "Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with \"the right to be forgotten\" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.", "AI": {"tldr": "GraphToxin\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f2\u7387\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u88ab\u5220\u9664\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u4e2a\u4eba\u94fe\u63a5\u53ca\u5176\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u7834\u574f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u9057\u5fd8\u867d\u7136\u7b26\u5408\"\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u6743\"\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff1a\u591a\u65b9\u53c2\u4e0e\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u5220\u9664\u6570\u636e\u6b8b\u7559\u75d5\u8ff9\u53ef\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u6062\u590d\u5df2\u5220\u9664\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7834\u574f\u56fe\u9057\u5fd8\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGraphToxin\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u4e3a\u5b8c\u6574\u9057\u5fd8\u56fe\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u767d\u76d2\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u8282\u70b9\u79fb\u9664\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "GraphToxin\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u6062\u590d\u88ab\u5220\u9664\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u94fe\u63a5\u53ca\u5176\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u57fa\u672c\u65e0\u6548\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "GraphToxin\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u56fe\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u968f\u673a\u548c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u8282\u70b9\u79fb\u9664\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement.

This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation.

Under review", "summary": "Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSUPER\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5b8c\u7f8e\u91cd\u6784\u7279\u6027\u9632\u6b62\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6291\u5236\u5197\u4f59\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u5347U-Net\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff08U-Net\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u5728\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u6062\u590d\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u6ce2\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u91cd\u6784\u7279\u6027\u9632\u6b62\u4fe1\u606f\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6291\u5236\u5197\u4f59\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5757\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5404\u79cdU-Net\u53d8\u4f53\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728CrackVision12K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u88c2\u7eb9\uff08\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5c0f\u4e8e4\u50cf\u7d20\uff09\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728SIDD\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u566a\u4e2dPSNR\u9002\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SUPER\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5757\u5177\u6709\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u91cd\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u9891\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks.

Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9c81\u68d2\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08URDA\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u8026\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08DART\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f3a\u8c03\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faURDA\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1DART\u7b97\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u5148\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u610fUDA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u84b8\u998f\u8fdb\u884c\u77ac\u65f6\u9c81\u68d2\u5316\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDART\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86URDA\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86URDA\u8303\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DART\u7b97\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.

However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58(HGC)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\uff1a(1) \u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58(\u5757\u7ea7)\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u52a8\u6001\u7ed5\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5757\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b(2) \u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58(\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7)\u5728\u6a21\u5757\u5185\u91cd\u7528\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u76f8\u90bb\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u76f8\u5e94\u6a21\u5757\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86HGC\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728COCO-Stuff\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c(MACs)\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e63%(\u4ece18.22T\u964d\u81f36.70T)\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u63a7\u5236\u57281.5%\u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "HGC\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "CrossMed\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u533b\u5b66\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684Modality-Anatomy-Task\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u542b20,200\u4e2a\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66AI\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u6210\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MAT\u6846\u67b6\u5c06CheXpert\u3001SIIM-ACR\u3001BraTS 2020\u548cMosMedData\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7edf\u4e00\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLaVA-Vicuna-7B\u548cQwen2-VL-7B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u3001\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u548c\u96f6\u91cd\u53e0MAT\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u523083.2%\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c0.75\u5206\u5272cIoU\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u548c\u96f6\u91cd\u53e0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u663e\u793a\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e5f\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd7% cIoU\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cCrossMed\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u6cdb\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u8c28\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

To address this problem, continual learning techniques for KGEs incorporate embeddings for new entities while updating the old ones. One necessary step in these methods is the initialization of the embeddings, as an input to the KGE learning process, which can have an important impact in the accuracy of the final embeddings, as well as in the time required to train them. This is especially relevant for relatively small and frequent updates. We propose a novel informed embedding initialization strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing continual learning methods for KGE, that enhances the acquisition of new knowledge while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the KG schema and the previously learned embeddings are utilized to obtain initial representations for the new entities, based on the classes the entities belong to. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed initialization strategy improves the predictive performance of the resulting KGEs, while also enhancing knowledge retention. Furthermore, our approach accelerates knowledge acquisition, reducing the number of epochs, and therefore time, required to incrementally learn new embeddings.

Supplementary material included after references. 27 pages, 21 figures, 11 tables", "summary": "4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency.

To enhance transparency while maintaining accuracy, we developed an interpretable deep learning framework for short-term precipitation prediction in four major Indian cities: Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, spanning diverse climate zones. We implemented a hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data. The architecture was optimized for each city with a different number of convolutional filters: Bengaluru (32), Mumbai and Delhi (64), and Kolkata (128). The models achieved root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata). Through interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation, we identified distinct patterns in the model's behavior. The model relied on city-specific variables, with prediction horizons ranging from one day for Bengaluru to five days for Kolkata.

Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+\u03b4$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality.

By making a machine-learning based weather forecasting model generative and applying this non-linear aggregation method, we achieve better accuracy in predicting extreme heat events than with the typical mean prediction from the same model. Our power aggregation method shows promise and adaptability, as its optimal performance varies with the quantile threshold chosen, demonstrating increased effectiveness for higher extremes prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5e42\u5747\u503c\u805a\u5408\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u70ed\u6d6a\u7b49\u6c14\u5019\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5747\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6c14\u5019\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u70ed\u6d6a\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u8868\u6c14\u6e29\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u8d85\u8fc7\u5176\u5c40\u90e8q\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u5e42\u5747\u503c\u8fd9\u4e00\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5e42\u5747\u503c\u805a\u5408\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6781\u7aef\u70ed\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u76f8\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5178\u578b\u5747\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u9608\u503c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bf9\u66f4\u9ad8\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e42\u5747\u503c\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6c14\u5019\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u9ad8\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \\textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \\textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \\textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization. Finally, a clustering module is constructed and optimized through a pseudo-label self-supervised training mechanism.

In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study.

We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function. It further introduces an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) that guides the sensor toward the tag with increasing confidence. We have validated LoRaCompass in ground-based and drone-assisted scenarios within diverse unseen environments covering an area of over 80km^2.

Accepted as an oral paper at AAAI-26 (Main Technical Track). Code and dataset: https://github.com/dualtransparency/Phys-Liquid-AAAI Project page: https://dualtransparency.github.io/Phys-Liquid/", "summary": "Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling.

To address this inefficiency, we introduce a zero-shot synthetic validation framework that leverages generative AI to monitor model performance and determine early stopping points.

For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances.

However, it remains vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks targeting local features, labels, smashed data, and model weights. Existing defenses, primarily adapted from traditional Federated Learning (FL), are less effective under SFL due to limited access to complete model updates. This paper presents HealSplit, the first unified defense framework tailored for SFL, offering end-to-end detection and recovery against five sophisticated types of poisoning attacks. HealSplit comprises three key components: (1) a topology-aware detection module that constructs graphs over smashed data to identify poisoned samples via topological anomaly scoring (TAS); (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency validation student; and (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework trains the student using semantic supervision from a Vanilla Teacher and anomaly-aware signals from an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by the alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, achieving superior robustness and defense effectiveness across diverse attack scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "HealSplit\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4e3aSplit Federated Learning\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6062\u590d\u4e94\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "Split Federated Learning\u867d\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u9488\u5bf9\u672c\u5730\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u7c89\u788e\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6539\u7f16\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728SFL\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "method": "HealSplit\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1) \u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7c89\u788e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6837\u672c\uff1b(2) \u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6062\u590d\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\uff1b(3) \u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Vanilla Teacher\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76d1\u7763\u548cAnomaly-Influence Debiasing Teacher\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHealSplit\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5341\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "HealSplit\u4e3aSplit Federated Learning\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SFL\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection.

Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHR\uff09\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u516b\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u764c\u75c7\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e2a\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0EHR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u771f\u5b9e\u764c\u75c7\u75c5\u4f8b\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u9ad8\u51fa3-6\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u764c\u75c7\u7b5b\u67e5\u6307\u5357\u4ec5\u8986\u76d6\u5c11\u6570\u764c\u75c7\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e74\u9f84\u6216\u5355\u4e00\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u7b49\u72ed\u7a84\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e2a\u4f53\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eEHR\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u764c\u75c7\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u524d\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7fa4\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528All of Us\u7814\u7a76\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u8d85\u8fc7865,000\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684EHR\u3001\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u548c\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30EHR\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u56e0\u7a81\u53d8\u548c\u764c\u75c7\u5bb6\u65cf\u53f2\uff09\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u516b\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u764c\u75c7\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e2a\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u7ebf\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cEHR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e2a\u4f53\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u764c\u75c7\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u5bcc\u96c6\u5ea6\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u9ad8\u51fa3-6\u500d\u3002EHR\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8626\u79cd\u764c\u75c7\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eEHR\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation.

Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction.

It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality.

Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u54cd\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578bRev\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u53d8\u5316\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u663e\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u53d8\u5316\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56e0\u679c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u58f0\u5b66\u6df7\u54cd\u66f2\u7ebf\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u54cd\u53d8\u6362\u548cRev\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u663e\u5f0f\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df7\u54cd\u6838\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u504f\u597d\u53ca\u5176\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRev\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u8de8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5ef6\u8fdf\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u54cd\u53d8\u6362\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time. This paper first provides a theoretical estimate of the relative model sizes that can be accommodated under BP and MeZO training. We then numerically validate the analysis, demonstrating that MeZO exhibits accuracy advantages under on-device memory constraints, provided sufficient wall-clock time is available for fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\uff08MeZO\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cMeZO\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u5411\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f30\u8ba1\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5b58\u50a8\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u90e8\u7f72\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u5185\u5b58\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u8981\u5b58\u50a8\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\uff08MeZO\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b58\u50a8\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6216\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0cMeZO\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "MeZO\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., \"Crack\" vs. \"Scratch\") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times.

Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records.

Project Page- https://refine-align.github.io/", "summary": "In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.", "AI": {"tldr": "AlignVQA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fa9\u8bba\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fdb\u884c\u6279\u8bc4\u3001\u7cbe\u70bc\u548c\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\uff08\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684VQA\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAlignVQA\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4e13\u95e8VLM\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u7b54\u6848\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fa9\u8bba\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6279\u8bc4\u3001\u7cbe\u70bc\u548c\u805a\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63d0\u8bae\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570aligncal\u6765\u5fae\u8c03\u4e13\u95e8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6VQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6821\u51c6\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u66f4\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "AlignVQA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86VQA\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u975e\u540c\u6b65\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u76844D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7cbe\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8865\u507f\u76f8\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u5e38\u56e0\u76f8\u673a\u89e6\u53d1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u72ec\u7acb\u5f55\u5236\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u67094D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u95f4\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u5230\u7cbe\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5148\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e27\u7ea7\u7c97\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u518d\u7ec6\u5316\u4e3a\u4e9a\u5e27\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u67094DGS\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u4e864DGS\u5bf9\u975e\u540c\u6b65\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference.

If the predictor is the Bayes optimal one, then computing the best matching based on the predicted weights is optimal. However, in practice, this perfect information scenario is not realistic. Given an imperfect predictor, a suboptimal decision rule may compensate for the induced error and thus outperform the standard optimal rule.\n  In this paper, we propose multicalibration as a way to address this problem. This fairness notion requires a predictor to be unbiased on each element of a family of protected sets of contexts. Given a class of matching algorithms $\\mathcal C$ and any predictor $\u03b3$ of the edge-weights, we show how to construct a specific multicalibrated predictor $\\hat \u03b3$, with the following property. Picking the best matching based on the output of $\\hat \u03b3$ is competitive with the best decision rule in $\\mathcal C$ applied onto the original predictor $\u03b3$.

Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data. Three lightweight parameter-specific architectures are developed to improve accuracy, minimize systematic bias, and enable rapid inference.

First, we show that JAX-FEM's automatic differentiation (AD) enables direct gradient-based estimation of complex boundary admittance from sparse pressure measurements, achieving 3-digit precision without requiring manual derivation of adjoint equations. Second, we apply randomized finite differences to acoustic shape optimization, combining JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD. By separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation, we achieve 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference on the full mesh. This work showcases how modern differentiable software stacks enable rapid prototyping of optimization workflows for physics-based inverse problems, with automatic differentiation for parameter estimation and a combination of finite differences and AD for geometric design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7f16\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u58f0\u5b66\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\uff1a\u5bfc\u7eb3\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5171\u632f\u963b\u5c3c\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7JAX-FEM\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fb9\u754c\u5bfc\u7eb3\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u72b6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u58f0\u5b66\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u63a8\u5bfc\u4f34\u968f\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u73b0\u4ee3\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7f16\u7a0b\u5de5\u5177\u4e3a\u8fd9\u7c7b\u7269\u7406\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528JAX-FEM\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fb9\u754c\u5bfc\u7eb3\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u548cPyTorch3D\u8fdb\u884c\u58f0\u5b66\u5f62\u72b6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7f51\u683c\u9002\u914d\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u8fb9\u754c\u5bfc\u7eb3\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fbe\u52303\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u5f62\u72b6\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u9891\u7387\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b048.1%\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8630\u500d\u7684FEM\u6c42\u89e3\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6808\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u539f\u578b\u5316\u7269\u7406\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u7ed3\u5408\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 \u03bcm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.\n  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task.

Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "RETROFIT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u5408\u5e76\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u7a00\u758f\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5728\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u654f\u611f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u6574\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u6570\u636e\u56de\u653e\uff0c\u4e14\u9762\u4e34\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u5e76\u5148\u524d\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u65b0\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\u6559\u5e08\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u5408\u5e76\u3001\u4f4e\u79e9\u7a00\u758f\u66f4\u65b0\u9650\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u5230\u72ec\u7acb\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ef2\u88c1\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u6559\u5e08\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5206\u6570\u4ece20.2%\u63d0\u5347\u81f338.6%\uff1b\u5728\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\uff0cBLEU\u5206\u6570\u662f\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u4e24\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8de8\u8868\u793a\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "RETROFIT\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u9057\u5fd8\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u754c\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u6709\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002"}}

We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision.

However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns about whether these data-informed AI software decisions secure fairness against people of all racial, gender, or age groups. Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion. Theoretically, we show that the proposed FairReweighing algorithm can guarantee separation in the training data under a data independence assumption. Empirically, on both synthetic and real-world data, we show that FairReweighing outperforms existing state-of-the-art regression fairness solutions in terms of improving separation while maintaining high accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684FairReweighing\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6ee1\u8db3\u5206\u79bb\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5728\u516c\u5171\u90e8\u95e8\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u79bb\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u4f7f\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684FairReweighing\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6ee1\u8db3\u5206\u79bb\u51c6\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660eFairReweighing\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u56de\u5f52\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "FairReweighing\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6539\u5584\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings.

However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process.

While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored.

We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end.

Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones. Furthermore, motivated by our findings, we propose a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction. This allows us to determine appropriate thresholds for each group.

In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data.

Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research.

However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process.

This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an \"Embedding-as-Value\" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes.

As a result, there is a growing need to enhance the fairness of clustering outcomes, ideally by making minimal modifications, possibly as a post-processing step after conventional clustering. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] initiated the study of \\emph{closest fair clustering}, though in a restricted scenario where data points belong to only two groups. In practice, however, data points are typically characterized by many groups, reflecting diverse protected attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.\n  In this work, we generalize the study of the \\emph{closest fair clustering} problem to settings with an arbitrary number (more than two) of groups. We begin by showing that the problem is NP-hard even when all groups are of equal size -- a stark contrast with the two-group case, for which an exact algorithm exists. Next, we propose near-linear time approximation algorithms that efficiently handle arbitrary-sized multiple groups, thereby answering an open question posed by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].\n  Leveraging our closest fair clustering algorithms, we further achieve improved approximation guarantees for the \\emph{fair correlation clustering} problem, advancing the state-of-the-art results established by Ahmadian et al.

This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u513f\u7ae5\u6ce8\u89c6\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u65b0AI\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4ea4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u513f\u7ae5\u5728\u6d3b\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u70b9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7AI\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u76ee\u6807\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u90a3\u4e9b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u4e13\u4e1a\u8d44\u6e90\u6765\u6539\u5584\u751f\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u513f\u7ae5\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u6d4b\u91cf\u8054\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u800c\u8054\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u662f\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u8c31\u7cfb\u969c\u788d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u611f\u77e5\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u6ce8\u89c6\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e13\u95e8\u5904\u7406\u793e\u4ea4\u548c\u975e\u793e\u4ea4\u6ce8\u89c6\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u95e8\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u6ce8\u89c6\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u522b\u2014\u2014\u9762\u5411\u9762\u90e8\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684AI\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u793e\u4ea4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u6210\u529f\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u6ce8\u89c6\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "CountSteer\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ba1\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u6570\u503c\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u9075\u5faa\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u8fd9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u6709\u9690\u5f0f\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u8eab\u8ba1\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5bf9\u6570\u503c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCountSteer\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eCountSteer\u5c06\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ba1\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea64%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "CountSteer\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u63a7\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language.

However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.

In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial.

While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

Code: https://github.com/HaokunChen245/AUVIC", "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting.

This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u7eaf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8349\u83936D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316Blender\u7ba1\u9053\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528YOLOX-6D-Pose\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728RTX 3090\u548cJetson Orin Nano\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5148\u8fdb\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u77ed\u7f3a\u548c\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6c34\u679c\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91c7\u6458\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316Blender\u7ba1\u9053\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u5408\u6210\u8349\u8393\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528YOLOX-6D-Pose\u5355\u6b21\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c6D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728RTX 3090\u548cJetson Orin Nano\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0cRTX 3090\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\uff0cJetson Orin Nano\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6210\u719f\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u6210\u719f\u8349\u8393\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u672a\u6210\u719f\u8349\u8393\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u6c34\u679c\u5982\u82f9\u679c\u3001\u6843\u5b50\u3001\u674e\u5b50\u7b49\uff0c\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u989c\u8272\u53d8\u5316\u6539\u8fdb\u672a\u6210\u719f\u8349\u8393\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace\" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance.

While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.\n  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.\n  The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/paroj/ycbev_sd.", "AI": {"tldr": "YCB-Ev SD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e6DoF\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b50,000\u4e2a34\u6beb\u79d2\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eYCB-Video\u5bf9\u8c61\u548cBOP\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0e\u5e27\u57fa\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u6e32\u67d3(PBR)\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u573a\u666f\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u548c\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u6781\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u9762\u5728CNN\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u548c\u5355\u901a\u9053\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6781\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u6bd4\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u683c\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5373\u65f6\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002"}}

Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts.

Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($\u03bc$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures.

Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLSEF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u7a00\u758f\u539f\u7406\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u60c5\u611f\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u522b\u6355\u83b7\u60c5\u611f\u57fa\u3001\u77ac\u6001\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79e9\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u9762\u4e34\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u9650\u5236\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u8026\u60c5\u611f\u57fa\uff08\u957f\u671f\u60c5\u611f\u57fa\u8c03\uff09\u548c\u77ac\u6001\u6ce2\u52a8\uff08\u77ed\u671f\u60c5\u611f\u6ce2\u52a8\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLSEF\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u5757\u6355\u83b7\u4f4e\u79e9\u60c5\u611f\u57fa\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u79bb\u7a00\u758f\u77ac\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6574\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u91cd\u5efa\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u79e9\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u68af\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0cLSEF\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42\u4f4e\u79e9\u7a00\u758f\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u60c5\u611f\u52a8\u6001\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels.

We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher\" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student\" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm.

To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing.

This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6807\u5fd7\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5524\u8d77\u6587\u5316\u5171\u4eab\u5173\u8054\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u518d\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u79bb\u8bc6\u522b\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u8bc6\u522b\u53c2\u8003\uff09\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\uff08\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5236\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u8be0\u91ca\u63cf\u7ed8\u53c2\u8003\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eWikidata\u7684767\u4e2a\u6587\u5316\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u793a\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u5b57\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u533a\u5206\u590d\u5236\u4e0e\u8f6c\u6362\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u4f7f\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u6539\u53d8\u4e5f\u7ecf\u5e38\u518d\u73b0\u6807\u5fd7\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u6587\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u548c\u521b\u5efa\u65e5\u671f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u4e8e\u590d\u5236\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u66f4\u5728\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bed\u5883\u5316\u6587\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity.

When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use \"visual prompts\" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale.

However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u6570\u636e\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a1\uff09\u63a7\u5236\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u65e0\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5e73\u8861\u4e14\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u91c7\u6837\u7269\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u989c\u8272\u3001\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b3\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5fae\u8c03\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u5747\u5300\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u5e38\u89c1\u504f\u89c1\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u5408\u6210\u523a\u6fc0\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\uff08COCO\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5339\u914d\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u521b\u5efa\u65e0\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse.

We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect.

In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference.

Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities \"think\". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models.
